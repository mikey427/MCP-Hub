# MCP Hub - Project Overview

## Goal
Build a CLI-based hub to manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. This is a learning project focused on understanding AI integrations and MCP protocol.

## Core Objectives
- Learn about MCP servers and how they work
- Manage multiple MCP servers from a central CLI
- Monitor server status and usage metrics
- Start/stop MCP server processes
- Persist data using SQLite

## Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Database**: SQLite
- **CLI Framework**: Commander.js or Yargs
- **Process Management**: Node.js child processes
- **Future Stretch Goal**: React + Tailwind web UI

## MVP Scope (CLI Only)
The initial version will be entirely CLI-based. Web UI is planned as a future enhancement.

## Learning Focus
This project prioritizes learning about:
- MCP protocol and server development
- AI tool integrations
- Process management
- CLI application design
